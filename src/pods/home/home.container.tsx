          or anything else. I live in Almer√≠a, where the sun resides{" "}
          <span>&#127774;</span>. I have always been a curious person, enjoying
          the search for solutions to different problems. I also have a great
          interest in studying and innovating, especially in the field of
          technology.
        </p>
        I possess diverse qualifications in different areas; I have always
        embraced versatility. My background spans different fields, from
        programming to accounting, logistics, or English. Event I have also
        worked alongside my father in his carpentry workshop. Being a frontend
        developer gives me the opportunity to dedicate myself to what I am
        passionate about and contribute significantly to solving real-world
        problems.
